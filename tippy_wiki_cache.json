The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning. It was created by \"re-mixing\" the samples from NIST's original datasets. The creators felt that since NIST's training dataset was taken from American Census Bureau employees, while the testing dataset was taken from American high school students, it was not well-suited for machine learning experiments. Furthermore, the black and white images from NIST were normalized to fit into a 28x28 pixel bounding box and anti-aliased, which introduced grayscale levels.</p>", "Elo_rating_system": "<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f0/ArpadElo.jpg\" alt=\"Wikipedia thumbnail\" style=\"float:left; margin-right:10px;\"><p>The <b>Elo rating system</b> is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players in zero-sum games such as chess or esports.

It was proved by Jensen in 1906, building on an earlier proof of the same inequality for doubly-differentiable functions by Otto H\u00f6lder in 1889. Given its generality, the inequality appears in many forms depending on the context, some of which are presented below. In its simplest form the inequality states that the convex transformation of a mean is less than or equal to the mean applied after convex transformation.</p>"}
